- "In MVC, the model represents the information (the data) of the application and the business rules used to manipulate the data; the view orresponds to elements of the user interface such as text, checkbox items, and so forth; and the controller manages details involving the communication to the model of user actions." Model: Manage business-logic and data, View: Manage the presentation or the layout of the application, Controller: Connects Model with View, and routes request.  

- Tasks inside the server:  
    - Process user data (i.e. from a form) and store it  
    - Decide what to show the user

- urls.py and some of views.py - controller, Models - model, parts of views.py - view
